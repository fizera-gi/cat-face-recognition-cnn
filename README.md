# Cat Face Recognition using CNN (Kaggle)

## Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to recognize individual cats based on facial images.
The model is trained using transfer learning and evaluated on a small multi-class dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle and contains images of cat faces belonging to four different cats:
- Bibers
- Caramel
- Putchi
- Smokey

Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and resizing
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
- Fine-tuning on a custom dataset
- Model evaluation using accuracy and validation loss

## Results
The model achieved high validation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNN-based feature extraction for animal face recognition.

## Notebook
The full implementation and experiments are available in the Jupyter notebook:
- `cat_face_recognition.ipynb`

## Notes
The notebook was executed in a Kaggle environment using GPU acceleration.
Some runtime warnings are related to the execution environment and do not affect model performance.
